# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in the Touhou 6 macOS/Web reimplementation. This is a
clean-room fan engine — contributions of code, format research, and bug reports
are all welcome.

Please read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) first. The hard rules
there are not optional.

## The one rule that matters most

**Never commit, attach, or link copyrighted game data files.** No `.DAT`
archives, ripped sprite sheets, BGM/SFX audio, or executables. This repository
is code only. (Screenshots and short gameplay clips in issues are fine.) Patches that add
copyrighted assets will be rejected outright. All testing assumes you supply
your own legally purchased copy of *the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil* (v1.02h).

## Getting set up

Install the Rust toolchain from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs), then:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/TheScreamer74/Touhou6-Mac.git
cd Touhou6-Mac
cargo run -p th06 -- --game-dir "/path/to/your/th06/folder"
```

Web (WebAssembly) build:

```sh
wasm-pack build crates/game --release --target web --out-dir ../../web/pkg
cd web && python3 -m http.server 8080   # http://localhost:8080
```

## Project layout

```
crates/
├── formats   PBG3 archives · ANM sprites · ECL · STD · MSG
├── engine    wgpu sprite renderer · fixed-timestep loop · input · rodio audio
└── game      ANM VM · ECL VM · title menu · stage logic · background · scenes
```

When in doubt about original game behavior, the references in the README
([happyhavoc/th06](https://github.com/happyhavoc/th06),
[thtk](https://github.com/thpatch/thtk),
[PyTouhou](https://pytouhou.linkmauve.fr)) are the ground truth.

## Before you open a pull request

Run these and make sure they pass:

```sh
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
cargo build --workspace
```

## Pull request guidelines

- Keep changes focused — one logical change per PR.
- Match the surrounding code style; do not reformat unrelated code.
- Reference the issue you are fixing, if any.
- For behavior that aims to match the original game, say how you verified it
  (compared against the decompilation, observed in-game, etc.).
- Describe what you changed and why in the PR description.

## Reporting bugs and requesting features

Use the issue templates. For gameplay-accuracy bugs, include the stage,
character/shot type, and what the original game does differently.

For security or copyright concerns, do **not** open a public issue — use a
[private security advisory](https://github.com/TheScreamer74/Touhou6-Mac/security/advisories/new)
instead.
